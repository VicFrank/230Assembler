This is the readme for our 230 assembler

Assembler.java accepts as input a .txt file from the command line and outputs to a file named AssembledMemory.mif

Commands should be formatted as follows:

CMD1  ARG1,ARG2,ARG3
CMD2  ARG4,ARG6,ARG6
CMD3, ARG7,ARG8
ETC.

If you want to include immediate commands, don't put them in parenthesis, include them like a normal command
Even if the immediate value is going to be 0, include that in the line. Commands of the same type always take the same number of commands. That is:

R Type: 3
D Type: 3
B Type: 2
J Type: 1

Values must be entered in two's complement hex before being put into the assembler

EXAMPLES:

ADD r1,r2,r3
ADD 1,2,3

Assembly: LW r2,(12)r5
My Assembler: LW 2,C,5

If you want to include the S bit, simply add 'S' to the beginning of your command:

SCMD  ARG1,ARG2,ARG3
