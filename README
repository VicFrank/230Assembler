This is the readme for our 230 assembler

Assembler.java accepts as input a .txt file from the command line and outputs to a file named AssembledMemory.mif

Commands should be formatted as follows:

CMD1  ARG1,ARG2,ARG3
CMD2  ARG4,ARG6,ARG6
CMD3, ARG7,ARG8
ETC.

If you want to include immediate commands, don't put them in parenthesis, include them like a normal command
Even if the immediate value is going to be 0, include that in the line.

Here is the specific arguments for each command:
For R-Type Instructions:
  add,sub,and,or,xor,sll:
	  destinationReg,source1,source2
	  destinationReg,source1,source2
  cmp:
	  0,source1,source2
  jr:
	  0,source1,0

For D-Type Instructions:
  lw,sw,addi: 
	  destinationReg,sourceReg,Immediate
	  destinationReg,sourceReg,Immediate
	  destinationReg,sourceReg,Immediate
For B-Type Instructions:
  b,bal:
	  Label
For J-Type Instructions:
  j,jal:
	  constant
  li:
	  destinationReg,constant

Values must be entered in two's complement hex before being put into the assembler

EXAMPLES:

ADD r1,r2,r3
ADD 1,2,3

Assembly: LW r2,(12)r5
My Assembler: LW 2,C,5

If you want to include the S bit, simply add 'S' to the beginning of your command:

SCMD  ARG1,ARG2,ARG3
