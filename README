This is the readme for our 230 assembler

Assembler.java accepts as input a .txt file from the command line and outputs to a file named AssembledMemory.mif

Commands should be formatted as follows:

CMD1  ARG1,ARG2,ARG3
CMD2  ARG4,ARG6,ARG6
ETC.

For Example:

LW 2,-4,C 
Loads RC + (-4) into R2

If you want to include the S bit, simply add 'S' to the beginning of your command:

SCMD  ARG1,ARG2,ARG3

There need not be three Arguments, J 8 Should work just fine for instance
